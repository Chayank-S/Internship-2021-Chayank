1) Task : Once the installation is done, create all the users who are a part of this email ( mehul.intern, neha.intern etc  ). 
       Create a group called *intern* and add the users to that group

What was done : Created a group called "intern" - Command used 'groupadd intern'
                Cretaed all the users and added them to the group 'intern' - Command used to add users : 'adduser username'
                                                                             Command used to add the created users to the 'intern' group : 'usermod -G intern username'


2) Task : Add `2 disks each of 10GB each to this VM. Create a LVM using these two disks and create XFS filesystem on it.

What was done : a) Created 2 disks in the VM on the controller SATA of 10 gb
                b) Created physical volumes for each of the created disks - Command used : 'pvcreate /dev/sdb'  -> 1st created disk 
                                                                                           'pvcreate /dev/sdc'  -> 2nd created disk
                                                                                           
                c) Grouped the physical volumes to create a volume group - Command used : 'vgcreate vol1 /dev/sdb /dev/sdc'  -> vol1 is the name of the volume_group
                
                d) Created a logical volume above the volume group - Command used : 'lvcretae -n lv1 --size 19.99G vol1' -> 20GB of logical volume created over vol1
                e) Mounted a file system over the logical volume - Command used : 'mkfs.xfs /dev/vol1/lv1'
                f) Mounting to a different mount point /data - Command used : 'mount /dev/vol1/lv1 /data'

  SubTask : Mount this on /data directory and make sure that the mount persists across reboot

  What was done : Made an entry in /etc/fstab - Entry Format :        Device        | mounting_point | type_fs | operation | Backup_operations | File_System_Check_Order
                                                Entered      : /dev/mapper/vol1/lv1         /data        xfs         0                0                      0           


3) Task : Add another 10GB disk to the VM. Add it to the existing LVM

What was done : a) Created 1 disk in the VM on the controller SATA of 10 gb
                b) Created physical volume for the created disk - Command used : 'pvcreate /dev/sdd'  -> created disk 
                                                                                           
                c) Extended physical volume to existing volume group - Command used : 'vgextend vol1 /dev/sdd'  -> vol1 is the name of the volume_group
                
                d) Extended the logical volume above the volume group - Command used : 'lvextend --size 29.99G /dev/vol1/lv1' -> 30GB of logical volume extended over vol1


4) Task : run a http server on this VM . Make sure that the server starts automatically when the system start

What was done : a) Installed Nginx server - Command used : 'apt-get install nginx'
                b) Automatically start the server when the system starts - Command used : 'systemctl enable nginx'
                c) Other commands to manually start and stop and see the status of the server - Commands used : 'systemctl start nginx'   -> start nginx server
                                                                                                                'systemctl stop nginx'    -> stop nginx server
                                                                                                                'systemctl restart nginx' -> restart nginx server
                                                                                                                'systemctl status nginx'  -> status nginx server
                                                                                                                

5) Task : The users in the group interns should be able to login via a private key, and not a password

What was done : => Setting up the remote server VM
                   a) Formed a user : 'adduser user1' 
                   b) Switched to user1 : 'su user1'
                   c) Noted down the IP of the server VM : 'ifconfig'
                   
                => Setting up the local machine VM
                   a) Formed a user : 'adduser user1' 
                   b) Switched to user1 : 'su user1'
                   c) Generated the keys : 'ssh-keygen'  -> here did not enter the passphrase in the prompt, since the user should be able to login without password
                   d) Navigated to the /.ssh directory : 'cd .ssh' -> This directory consists of id_rsa and id_rsa.pub which are private and public keys respectively
                   e) The public key has to be sent to the server VM : 'ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub user1@IP_ADDRESS_SERVER' -> This copies the public key to the server
                   
                   Now the user can login directly : 'ssh user1@IPADDRESS_SERVER'  -> IPADDRESS_SERVER : ip address of the server

6) Task : Mount /var/log on a separate mount point

What was done : a) Configured OS for SIngle user Mode -> To avoid issues from occuring during mounting the system files
                b) Command used : sed-i 's/^id:3:/id:1:/g' /etc/inittab
                c) Added a new disk to the VM and shutdown the VM
                d) Created a new partition : fdisk /dev/sdb
                e) Created a volume group and logical volume : 'vgcreate vg_log /dev/sdb1'
                                                              'lvcreate -l 100%VG -n lvlog vglog'
                                                              
                f) Mounted a file system to it : 'mkfs -t ext4 /dev/vg_log/lv_log'
                g) Mounted it to a temporary directory : 'mkdir /mnt/temp/vol'
                                                       'mount -t ext4 /dev/vg_log/lv_log /mnt/tmp_vol/
                                                       
                h) Moved the existing var/log to the new location : 'mv /var/log* /mnt/tmp_vol'
